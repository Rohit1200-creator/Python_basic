    "\n",
    "4. Large Standard Library: Python has an extensive collection of libraries and modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variable types before using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Cross-Platform: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Open-Source: Python is open-source, which means it's free to use and distribute.\n",
